Ths was a great opportunity for me to work on a team in a coding role. I believe I got a chance to both show my skills and get better at leaning on others for help.

I do think I could get better at technical problem solving as I feel likeI spent a lot of time asking Jmmiy/Chris for help, as opposed to leaning on my teammates and/or troubleshooting/debugging myself.

It was amazing, as always, to see the final output after working so hard to getthing working and overcoming hurdles.

Can't wait for my new team and the next sprint.
